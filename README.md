## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹
Thanks for checking out this front-end coding challenge solution. The challenge was to build out this product list project that includes a functional cart and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

## Features
Users can:

- Add items to the cart and remove them.
- Increase/decrease the number of items in the cart.
- See an order confirmation modal when they click "Confirm Order."
- Reset their selections when they click "Start New Order."
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size.
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page.
- View real-time updates to the cart's total price and item quantities.

## Technologies Used

- React.js: For building reusable components and managing application state.
- Tailwind CSS: For rapid and responsive UI styling.
- React Hooks: Used for managing component state (e.g., useState and useEffect).
- CSS Transitions: For subtle animations (e.g., order modal display).
